# The Rise of The Sorceler
This is my first attempt of creating a roguelike game.

## TODO
* Find a cleaner way to change maps as the actual way is not saving any changes made before.
So if I open a chest on map1, travel on map2 and get back, map1 will be reset and the chest will be full.

+ Method to open chests
+ Method to open doors/break walls
Maybe I will use a 'key' system where player have to posses a tagged key which allows him to open door or break walls.
If I do like so :
+ Implement an inventory system

+ Dialogs
+ NPC interactions
