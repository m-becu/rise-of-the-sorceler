# The Rise of The Sorceler
This is my first attempt of creating a roguelike game.

## List of functionnalities
+ Movement and collisions
+ Sprites, animations, maps
+ Interact with chests/doors (if you have the key).
+ Triggers and passages
+ Basic inventory system

### What's new
I managed to give player possiblity to change maps by traveling, I used a system a "views" : Pygame is drawing entities and images on thos views and when changing the map it's just like changing the view so pygame know which one it has to draw.
I don't know if it's the correct way to do it but this system works and I'm very proud.

## TODO
+ Dialogs
+ NPC interactions
